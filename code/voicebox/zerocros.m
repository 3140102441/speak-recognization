function [t,s]=zerocros(x,m)
%ZEROCROS finds the zeros crossings in a signal [T,S]=(X,M)% find zero crossings in a signal
% Inputs:  x = input waveform
%          m = mode string containing:
%              'p' - positive crossings only
%              'n' - negative crossings only
%              'b' - both (default)
%              'r' - round to integer values
%
% Outputs: t = sample positions of zero crossings (not necessarily integers)
%          s = estimated slope of x at the zero crossing
%
% This routine uses linear interpolation to estimate the position of a zero crossing
% A zero crossing occurs between x(n) and x(n+1) iff (x(n)>=0) ~= (x(n+1)>=0)

% Example: x=sin(2*pi*(0:1000)/200); x(1:100:1001)=0; zerocros(x);
% Note that we get a zero crossing at the end but not at the start.
