function [frq,bnd] = erb2frq(erb)
%ERB2FRQ  Convert ERB frequency scale to Hertz FRQ=(ERB)
%	frq = erb2frq(erb) converts a vector of ERB-rate values
%	to the corresponding frequencies in Hz.
%   [frq,bnd] =  erb2frq(erb) also calculates the ERB bandwidths
%
%    Note that erb values must not exceed 42.79.
%    The inverse function is frq2erb.

%   The erb scale is measured using the notched-noise method [3].
%
%	We have df/de = 6.23*f^2 + 93.39*f + 28.52
%	where the above expression gives the Equivalent Rectangular
%	Bandwidth (ERB)in Hz  of a human auditory filter with a centre
%	frequency of f kHz.
%
%	By integrating the reciprocal of the above expression, we
%	get:
%		e = a ln((f/p-1)/(f/q-1))/c
%
%	where p and q are the roots of the equation: -0.312 and -14.7
%  	and c = (6.23*(p-q))/1000 = 0.08950404
%
%	from this we can derive:
%
%	f = a/(b-exp(c*e)) - d
%
%	where a = 1000 q (1 - q/p) = 676170.4
%	      b = q/p = 47.06538
%	      d = -1000q = 14678.49
%	and f is in Hz
